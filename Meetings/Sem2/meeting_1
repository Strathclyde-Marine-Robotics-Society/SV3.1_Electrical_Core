# Meeting 1

Meeting Date: 21/01/2026
Actual time of writing this document: the 22nd.
Attendees: Sandy, Alfie, Ezra, Eli, Michael, Owen
Absences: Ben

### Topics

1. Recap of Electrical System
  1. Killswitch Investigation
    1. Question: Why are there two wireless killswitches? - Car key, RC switch.
    2. Assumption: Car and the emergency button have identical behaviour (aside from range)
    3. Potential Reason: The car key offers redundancy, which is a priority
    4. Investigation/ Future Work: Does the RC have idential behaviour to the other killswitch options? If so, do we keep it? If not, is the different functionality useful to keep?
  2. ESC Transient Suppression
    1. Investigation: Do current ESC's have transient suppression? (when motor power is cut while its moving, we want to prevent transients)

2. Sytem Functionality Requirements
  1. Broke down into 4 main areas
    1. MCU, Diagnostic System, Antennae, Power
  2. Additional detailed requirements were added
    1. Still need to get down to implementation requirements

3. To-Do Items Discussed
  1. Owen - Create markdown file containing the functional requirements on accessible repository.
  2. Sandy - Create dependency matrix (clearly lays out what systems are dependent on eachother).
  3. Owen - Create a to-do list/ board.
  4. Owen - Arrange meeting with software team to understand networking infrastructure (may no longer be necessary).

### Relevant Notes from General Meeting

Attendees: Alex, Asa, Owen

1. Check electrical inventory to prevent duplicate purchases
.
2. Discussion with Alex on new electrical system
  1. Relayed high level system requirements.
  2. Broke that down into high level tasks. 
  3. Gantt chart created by Alex as a suggested timescale for each task. 
  4. To-Do: Break down each high level task into sub tasks with team, assign owners of each task.
  5. Note: Alex wishes to be involved in physical layout of the electronics within the box. 

3. Software Team Discussion
  3. Software teams requires the following connections
  	1. LIDAR over ethernet 
  	2. JETSON over ethernet to router
  	3. BULLET over ethernet
  4. Discussion with software team (Asa) on nework hardware issues.
    1. Three devices are required to be conected over ethernet 
    2. The router only has two ethernet ports, creating a need for a network switch - which adds several more ethernet connections to the router. 
    3. Unsure if the router or network switch are making devices on the network run slower, the setup may change.
  5. To-Do: Software team to produce a docuement detailing their hardware requirements. 

6. Previous challenge during Njord: Interference with other boats during the challenge. 
  1. Asa mentioned the need for a seperate radio.
  1. Owen mentioned how the diagnostic system would have a seperate radio - idea recieved well. 
  2. Legal radio bands need to be researched, must work within Norway and the UK. 
  3. Potential for interference between the Wi-Fi, Diagnostics radio and RC radio. Unsure of the severity.
