### General Meeting Notes
1. Networking Infrastructure
	1. Local network
		1. Jetson, Lidar and the Router
		2. All 3 connected over LAN
		3. LAN was very slow, bottleneck was the router, the connector was 100mbs
		4. The new router would be in the gigs and would be 5G, significantly improving the local network
	2. Global network
		1. bridge at 865MHz is used to connect between shore and the boat. 
			1. This is slower transmission, but will allow us to actually connect to the boat. And avoid interference.
